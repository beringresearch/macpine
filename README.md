# Lightweight Alpine VMs on MacOS

Create and manage lightweight Alpine VMs on MacOS with:


:repeat: Seamless port forwarding

:card_index_dividers: Automatic file sharing

:roller_coaster: Bridged networking

:rocket: aarch64 and x86_64 emulation

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to enable MacOS users to:

1. Easily spin up and manage lightweight Alpine Linux / Debian environments.
2. Use tiny VMs to take advantage of containerisation technologies, including [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) and Docker.
3. Build and test software on x86_64 and aarch64 systems.

# Installation

Macpine depends on QEMU >= 6.2.0_1:

```bash
#brew update
#brew upgrade
brew install qemu
```

## Install the latest binary

Download the [latest binary release](https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine/releases) for your system and add it to your path by placing to e.g. `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
wget https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine/releases/download/v.06/alpine_darwin_arm64
mv alpine_darwin_arm64 alpine
sudo chmod +x alpine
sudo mv alpine /usr/local/bin/
```

## Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine
cd macpine
make
```

# Getting Started

To launch a brand new VM:

```bash
alpine launch #launches with default parameters
alpine launch -a aarch64 #create an aarch64 instance
alpine launch -i debian_11.3.0 #create a Debian instance
alpine launch -d 10G -c 4 -m 2048 #create a machine with a 10GB disk, 4 cpus and 2GB of RAM
```

Access VM via ssh:

```bash
alpine launch -s 22 #launch a VM and expose SSH port to host port 22
ssh root@localhost -p 22 #password: root
```

Expose additional VM ports to host:

```bash
alpine launch -s 23 -p 8888,5432 #launch a VM, expose SSH to host port 23 and forward VM ports 8888 and 5432 to host ports 8888 and 5432
```

VMs can be easily packaged for export and re-use as tar.gz files:

```bash
alpine list

NAME                STATUS      SSH    PORTS ARCH        PID 
forthright-hook     Running     23           aarch64     91598
hot-cow             Running     22           x86_64      82361
```

```bash
alpine publish hot-cow
```

This will create a file hot-cow.tar.gz which can be imported as:

```bash
alpine import hot-cow.tar.gz
```
