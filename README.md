# Lightweight Alpine VMs on MacOS

Create and manage lightweight Alpine VMs on MacOS with:


:repeat: Seamless port forwarding

:card_index_dividers: Automatic file sharing

:roller_coaster: Bridged networking

:rocket: aarch64 and x86_64 emulation

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to enable MacOS users to:

1. Easily spin up and manage lightweight Alpine Linux environments.
2. Use tiny VMs to take advantage of containerisation technologies, including [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) and Docker.
3. Build and test software on x86_64 and aarch64 systems.

# Installation

Macpine depends on QEMU >= 6.2.0_1:

```bash
#brew update
#brew upgrade
brew install qemu
```

## Install the latest binary

Download the [latest binary release](https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine/releases) for your system and add it to your path by placing to e.g. `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
wget https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine/releases/download/v0.10/alpine_darwin_arm64
mv alpine_darwin_arm64 alpine
sudo chmod +x alpine
sudo mv alpine /usr/local/bin/
```

## Install from Homebrew

```bash
brew install macpine
```

## Install from MacPorts

On macOS, you can install via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):

```bash
sudo port install macpine
```

See more information [here](https://ports.macports.org/port/macpine/).

## Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beringresearch/macpine
cd macpine
make
```


# Getting Started

To launch a brand new VM:

```bash
alpine launch #launches with default parameters
alpine launch -a aarch64 #create an aarch64 instance
alpine launch -d 10G -c 4 -m 2048 #create a machine with a 10GB disk, 4 cpus and 2GB of RAM

```

Access VM via ssh:

```bash
alpine launch -s 22 #launch a VM and expose SSH port to host port 22
ssh root@localhost -p 22 #password: root
alpine ssh $VMNAME #attach to the VM shell
```

Expose additional VM ports to host:

```bash
alpine launch -s 23 -p 8888,5432 #launch a VM, expose SSH to host port 23 and forward host ports 8888 and 5432 to VM ports 8888 and 5432
alpine launch -s 8023 -p 8081:8082,8083 #launch a VM, expose SSH to host port 8023, forward host port 8081 to VM port 8082, and forward
                                        #host port 8083 to VM port 8083
```

VMs can be easily packaged for export and re-use as tar.gz files:

```bash
alpine list

NAME                 OS         STATUS      SSH    PORTS ARCH      PID     TAGS
cheerful-result      alpine     Running     25           aarch64   26568
glittering-swing     alpine     Running     23           x86_64    57206   emulation,intel
```

```bash
alpine publish cheerful-result
```

This will create a file cheerful-result.tar.gz which can be imported as:

```bash
alpine import cheerful-result.tar.gz
```

Refer also to the [quickstart guide](docs/docs/quickstart.md) and [troubleshooting documentation](docs/docs/troubleshooting.md).
